# The Code & Coffee Manifesto
## A statement on beliefs and community values
#### Adapted from (Code & Coffee: Vancouver)[https://github.com/Code-and-Coffee-YVR]

We commit to nurturing ourselves and each other. Through experience, we have found that being open, empathetic and experimental leads to growth for yourself and others. Simply put, well-being is the foundation of all good experience. You are more than just a programmer: you are not your code, your commit history, or your résumé.

With these ideals in mind, take risks! Succeed. Fail. Ask for help. Get encouragement. Redesign. Be humbled. Toy with new concepts. Enjoy what you do and be gentle with yourself. Gentleness and kindness are strengths! Take pride in showing them.

Find growth. Build things that you find meaningful. Importantly, cultivate a variety of interests. They will craft you in surprising ways.

Follow your passions, and discover new ones. This is why we are here. This attitude is in all that we do.

Keep our (Code of Conduct)[https://github.com/Code-and-Coffee-Uptown-Brigade/codeofconduct] in mind.
